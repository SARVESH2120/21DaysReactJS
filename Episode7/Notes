UseEffect


useeffect is called after every render of the component.
useefect has two argument-- callback function and dependecy array
//dependecy arrays changes the render behaviour
Case-1 }} if no depedency array ==> useeffect called on every render.
Case-2 }} if depedency array is empty = [] => useeffect is called on initial render(just once).
Case-3}} if dependecy array is [btnNameReact] ==> every time btnNameReact is updated.


UseState




Never create hooks{useState} outside of component..
It is used to create a local state variable inside your functional component...
Always try to call a hook on top
never used inside a if-else and for-loop and function
Only create inside the functional component and also place a  top of component
